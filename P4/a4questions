For ALL cache simulations, use a capacity of 16384 bytes for both 
the I-cache and the D-cache.

cache1D
-------

Describe how you tested your code to verify that it works.
	Output each array element( or every 100/ random number of elements) after arr[i] = i. 
	Using gdb, setting breakpoints and checking values
	of array elements will also work.

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes?
	Instruction cache misses: 5994
	Instruction cache references: 695569
	Data cache misses: 108332
	Data cache references: 646507

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?
	Hit Ratio = number of hits/ number of references
			= (#references - #misses)/# references
			= (695569 - 5994)/ 695569
			= 0.9913

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?
	Hit Ratio = #hits/ # references
			= (#references - #misses)/#references
			= (646507 - 108332)/ 646507
			= 0.8324
	
What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes?
	Instruction cache misses: 1167
	Instruction cache references: 695569
	Data cache misses: 14982
	Data cache references: 646507

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?
	Hit Ratio = #hits/ # references
			= (#references - #misses)/#references
			= (695569 - 1167)/ 695569
			= 0.9983

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?
	Hit Ratio = #hits/ # references
			= (#references - #misses)/#references
			= (646507 - 14982)/ 646507
			= 0.9768

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?
	Instruction cache misses: 712
	Instruction cache references: 695569
	Data cache misses: 8452
	Data cache references: 646507

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	Hit Ratio = #hits/ # references
			= (#references - #misses)/#references
			= (695569 - 712)/ 695569
			= 0.9989

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	Hit Ratio = #hits/ # references
			= (#references - #misses)/#references
			= (646507 - 8452) / 646507
			= 0.9869

Which block size is best for the I-cache?  Why?
	64 byte block size is the best for the I-cache as the 
	hit ratio is the highest for the 64 byte block. This 
	means that the misses were less frequent making it more 
	efficient.


Which block size is best for the D-cache?  Why? In what way does the block 
  size affect the hit ratio for this program?
	64 byte block size is the best for D-cache as the hit 
	ratio is the highest for the 64 byte block. 
	The high hit ratio implies that the misses were less 
	frequent resulting in a more efficient byte block size. 
	As compared to other block sizes, 64 bytes block size has 
	lower number of conflict memory due to the larger space available. 
	So based on the size of block, the conflict misses will vary. Smaller 
	block size having more conflict misses and larger block 
	size having lower frequency of conflict misses resulting 
	in different hit ratios.

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?
	Instruction cache misses: 708
	Instruction cache references:16616589
	Data cache misses: 106952     
	Data cache references:12061510 

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	Hit Ratio = #hits/ # references
			= (#references - #misses)/#references
			= ( 16616589 - 708)/ 16616589
			= 0.99995

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	Hit Ratio = #hits/ # references
			= (#references - #misses)/#references
			= ( 12061510 - 106952) / 12061510
			= 0.99113

cache2Dcols

What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes?
	Instruction cache misses: 703
	Instruction cache references: 16599089
	Data cache misses: 1507413     
	Data cache references:12049010  

What is the hit ratio for the I-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	Hit Ratio = #hits/ # references
			= (#references - #misses)/#references
			= (16599089 - 703)/ 16599089
			= 0.99995

What is the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	Hit Ratio = #hits/ # references
			= (#references - #misses)/#references
			= ( 12049010 - 1507413)/ 12049010
			= 0.87489

Comparison of cache2Drows and cache2Dcols
-----------------------------------------

Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the I-cache for these 2 programs.
Justify your statistics.
	The hit ratios are the same for both the I- cache. 
	This is because the implementation of both the 2 types 
	of 2-D arrays affect the data and not the actual 
	instructions. Hence the similar hit ratio is expected 
	for both the 2-d arrays.

Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the D-cache for these 2 programs.
Explain any differences.
	The hit ratios of the D-cache is higher for the cache2Drows program. 
	This is because of the fact that C has a row major 
	implementation which makes cache2Drows 
	have a better performance. Row major implies that 
	the data is in spatial locality, i.e placed closer for the same 
	row. Hence resulting in the higher D-cache hit 
	ratio for the cache2Drows program.
